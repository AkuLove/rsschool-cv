**About me**
---

My name is Marat Nikolaev, i'm 21 years old, live in Belarus, Vitebskaya voblast, Vitebsk. In 2020 i'm graduated from the Educational Institution "Vitebsk State Medical College named after Academician I.P. Antonov" / Medical-preventive business. After finishing my studies and starting my professional career, I realized that there is no future for my profession. I started looking for myself and after a while I found myself in programming. And now I really want to develop in this direction, I like to learn and cope with difficulties. My goal is to get all possible knowledge in the direction of frontend development and maybe change my life in the future.
